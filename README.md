# BMP_Exercise3_final
Final Exercise Biomolecular Programming - Differentiation of tissues during development

Welcome to the repositiory for my submission for the BMP 2020 final,

A couple useful pieces of information:

- The main program is called "Exercise3_final.java" and can be found in BMP_Exercise3_final/NanoProg/nanocourse/Exercise3_final.java or by clicking the [on this link!](/NanoProg/nanocourse/Exercise3_final.java)

That's all for now,
Regards,
